# Music Turntable

A web-based DJ turntable app built with JavaScript and [WaveSurfer.js](https://wavesurfer-js.org/) for audio waveform visualization and playback. This app allows users to drag and drop tracks onto two decks, control playback, loop, volume, pitch, and upload their own music files.

## Features

- Dual DJ decks with waveform visualizations
- Drag-and-drop tracks from the music library onto decks
- Upload local audio files and add them to the library dynamically
- Play, pause, loop, and cue points for each deck
- Volume and pitch control for each deck
- Search and filter tracks by genre
- Crossfader control for smooth transitions between decks
